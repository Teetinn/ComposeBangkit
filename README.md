# ComposeBangkit
ComposeBangkit is an application that I made to understand how Jetpack Compose works.
I created a list using the data from Honkai Star Rail Wiki to create 10 different cards.

## App Features:
### 1. List, Cards & Details
The user is able to view a list of Honkai Star Rail characters containing image, character name and description.
User is also able to click on the card to view the character details.
### 2. Profile
User is able to view my profile when the profile icon on the action bar is clicked.
